## Natas 12

Visit this [link](http://natas12.natas.labs.overthewire.org/) to go to level 11 for which youâ€™ll need the password from the previous level.

You'll land on a page where you can upload a file. Our objective here to upload a php file and get code execution.

The problem is that even if you upload a php file it gets renamed in to a jpg file so we need to intercept the request and change the file extension.

* First name a simple file with the following content

```php
<?php system($_GET['cmd'];) ?>
```

select the file and intercept the request and change the extenion to php as shown in the picture

After the file is uploaded you'll be given a link looking something like this 

http://natas12.natas.labs.overthewire.org/upload/<random string>.php

You now have code execution on the server and can simply get the flag with the folloing command
